# Static NAT Lab (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This lab demonstrates the concept of **Static NAT (Network Address Translation)** using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## 🧠 What is Static NAT?

Static NAT is a one-to-one mapping between a private IP address and a public IP address. It allows devices inside a private network to be accessible from outside the network using a consistent public IP.

## 🎯 Lab Purpose

- Understand how static NAT works in a basic network.
- Learn where and why NAT is configured on a router.
- Practice verifying NAT operation using router commands.

## 📁 Included File

- `static-nat-lab.pkt` — The Packet Tracer lab file

## 🔧 Tools

- Cisco Packet Tracer



This is a beginner-friendly lab for those learning basic network configuration and NAT concepts. No prior experience required.
